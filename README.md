# Dotfiles - Mostly vim for now. ;)

## Installation

git clone "https://github.com/lnus/dotfiles.git" "~/dotfiles"

## Caps lock to ESC

I previously used an AutoHotKey script to change my Caps-Lock key to be used as an Escape key, however I now use [SharpKeys](https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys).

## Font

The font I use can be downloaded from [HERE](https://github.com/sgolovine/PlexNerdfont)!
