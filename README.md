## Vundle

In order to get my plugins, you need to install Vundle.
I've left a batch script in 'vimfiles/bundles' to install the package, but you also need to follow some directions from [here](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).

In order to install new plugins, just read my vimrc and you should be able to figure it out.

## Caps lock to ESC

I previously used an AutoHotKey script to change my Caps-Lock key to be used as an Escape key, however I now use [SharpKeys](https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys).
